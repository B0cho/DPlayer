# DziobakPlayer
A first cpp + Qt project, which is based on C++11 standard. The goal is to create my self-dedicated media player, which my most desired functionalities are:
  - Listening, saving and managing favourite pointed fragments of media,
  - Youtube and other music services integration,
  - Integration of data with mobile app and own server/cloud

Project uses Windows Registry to store user settings and two SQLite databases to store fragments and playlists.
