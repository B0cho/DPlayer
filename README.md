# DPlayer
A first C++11/14 Qt project. The goal is to create my self-dedicated media player, which my most desired functionalities are:
  - Listening, saving and managing favourite pointed fragments of media,
  - Youtube and other music services integration (in the future),
  - Integration of data with mobile app and own server/cloud (in the future)

Project uses Windows Registry / Linux config to store user settings and a SQLite3 database to store fragments and playlists.
It also applies Qt View-Model pattern for showing and manipulating their data - copying, renaming, deleting.
